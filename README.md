# pokemon-api

Pokemon are categorized into different colors. This application has the user select a color and it will return a Pokemon of that color. This is my first project using an API. I had to read through the documentation to understand what the input has to be. And a thorough understanding of arrays and objects definitely helped in extracting the information of interest. Errors were returned for certain Pokemon with different forms, but I overcame them by nesting API fetches. Nesting was confusing at first, but it's similar to nesting other things like if statements and loops.
